"""File responsibility: Diff view interface definition.

This protocol defines the interface for diff views. Views handle both
translation of templates (from translation_strings.py) AND parameter
substitution using Qt-style placeholders (%1, %2, etc.). Presenters pass
raw data only - they never format user-facing messages.

Translation Strategy for Summary:
    The show_summary method passes raw integers. The view should translate
    individual labels and combine them with values:

        def show_summary(self, added: int, deleted: int, modified: int) -> None:
            added_label = QCoreApplication.translate("DiffView", DIFF_SUMMARY_ADDED_LABEL)
            deleted_label = QCoreApplication.translate("DiffView", DIFF_SUMMARY_DELETED_LABEL)
            modified_label = QCoreApplication.translate("DiffView", DIFF_SUMMARY_MODIFIED_LABEL)

            self._addedLabel.setText(f"{added_label} {added}")
            self._deletedLabel.setText(f"{deleted_label} {deleted}")
            self._modifiedLabel.setText(f"{modified_label} {modified}")
