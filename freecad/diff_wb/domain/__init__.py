"""Domain models for the Diff Workbench.

This package contains the core domain models that represent FreeCAD documents
and snapshots. These models are pure Python with no FreeCAD dependencies,
enabling easy testing and validation. It also defines port interfaces
(Protocols) for external system interactions.
